![](sales-intro.jpg)

## Introduction:
In today’s fast-paced business environment, sales remain the lifeblood of any organization. However, in the rush to close deals, the bigger picture often gets overlooked. To uncover the hidden trends and performance drivers behind sales success, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Activewear Sales Data.
Using Power Query for Data cleaning & transformation, DAX Measures for calculated columns, Dynamic metric selection, Power BI for visualization. I analysed key metrics such as: 

Total Revenue, & Profit KPIs, 
Regional Sales & State-level Performance, 
Profit by Sales Channel,
Top Product Categories & Best-Selling Products,
Monthly & Yearly Sales Comparison,
Year-over-Year % Change,
 Interactive Slicers & Dynamic Filters to uncover valuable insights that can help Active wear optimise their sales strategies and achieve even greater results.

This data comprises 3 distinct tables such as sales, calendar, and product table.

## Insights
- Between 2021 and 2022, both Revenue and Profit showed steady growth. However, in 2023, the company experienced a slight decline in revenue and profit, dropping by 0.99% and 0.74%, respectively. Encouragingly, 2024 marked a strong rebound, with revenue increasing by 8.22% and profit by 8.32%.
- Top-performing products include jackets, sneakers, backpacks, yoga mats, and leggings, all showing strong sales performance. The #South Region emerged as the most profitable in 2024, recording a total profit of# $23,629.
- The marketplace has proven to be the highest revenue-generating sales channel.

### Best Selling Months

- Investigating further into monthly sales, it showed that in totality, June brought in the highest revenue for all 4 years(2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024). However, when investigated carefully, by comparing each month for each year, it was observed that June was not the month that brought in the highest revenue on its own, as it fluctuates year in year out.

### Highest Revenue Location
Wisconsin generated the highest total revenue for the company over the year, indicating a strong market presence. This suggests an opportunity to deepen investment in marketing and promotional efforts within the state. However, it’s worth noting that Wisconsin hasn’t consistently led in revenue on a year-over-year basis.

 
## Conclusion and Recommendation
- To optimise sales, the company should invest in expanding inventory for high-performing products.
- While current sales trends are positive, the company should explore additional sales-driving strategies, including the Pareto principle(80/20 rule) & email marketing, sponsored advertisement on social media, and nurture their existing strong customer by utilizing the base email list to send targeted promotions, updates, and new products.
- To increase sales, the company should consider hiring more salespersons in regions with high sales potential, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, etc.
- Also, by conducting a deeper analysis to identify the specific factors driving sales in Wisconsin, the company can implement similar strategies in other locations to achieve similar growth.
- Given that the marketplace has proven to be the highest revenue-generating sales channel, the company should consider allocating more resources toward optimizing and expanding its presence on this platform. This includes improving product listings, leveraging targeted advertising, and enhancing customer engagement to maximize revenue potential.
- Additionally, the company is encouraged to strengthen its online visibility through strategic digital marketing efforts such as SEO, social media engagement, and email campaigns. There appears to be an untapped market segment for the online store, which presents a valuable opportunity for growth and brand expansion outside of third-party platforms.
